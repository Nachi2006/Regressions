#Regressions
Wine Quality Analysis Project
Created for: IEEE-CS VIT Vellore Chapter

Project Purpose
This project was developed to provide a hands-on introduction to four core regression and classification methods in machine learning, specifically tailored for the IEEE-CS VIT Vellore Chapter. The goal is to explain and demonstrate the practical differences, strengths, and interpretation of each method using the Wine Quality dataset.

Methods Explained
Method           	   Type	            Description
Linear Regression	   Regression	      Predicts continuous output using a linear combination of input features.
Ridge Regression	   Regression	      Linear regression with L2 regularization to prevent overfitting by penalizing large weights.
Lasso Regression	   Regression	      Linear regression with L1 regularization, which can shrink less important features to zero.
Logistic Regression	 Classification	  Predicts binary outcomes by modeling the probability of the positive class.

Why These Methods?

Linear Regression: Foundation for understanding predictive modeling.

Ridge & Lasso Regression: Introduce regularization to handle overfitting and feature selection.

Logistic Regression: Demonstrates how regression techniques can be adapted for classification tasks.

Project Highlights

Dataset: Wine Quality (Red Wine) from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Exploration: Visualizations and statistics to understand data distributions and relationships.

Modeling: Implementation and comparison of all four methods.

Evaluation: Metrics and visualizations to interpret model performance and feature importance.
